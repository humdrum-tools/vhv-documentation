Pressing <span class="keypress">alt-v</span> will toggle between
the [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) and basic
editing modes for the text editor. 

VHV starts out with the basic editor, as indicated by the yellowish background
to the text editor:

{% include image.html
	file="basic-editing.png"
	alt="basic editing mode"
	url="http://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales/chor012.krn"
	caption="basic editing mode (indicated by the yellow color of the text editor)."
	caption-margin-top="-20px"
%}

Typing <span class="keypress">alt-v</span> will toggle the editor to and
from vim mode.  When in vim mode, the text editor has a dark blue background:

{% include image.html
	file="vim-editing.png"
	alt="vim editing mode"
	caption="vim editing mode (indicated by the dark blue color of the text editor)."
	url="http://verovio.humdrum.org/?file=chorales/chor012.krn"
	caption-margin-top="-20px"
%}

Typing <span class="keypress">alt-v</span> while in vim editing mode will return
to basic editing mode.
