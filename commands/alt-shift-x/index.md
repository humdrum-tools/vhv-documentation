By pressing <span class="keypress">alt-shift-x</span>, you can
toggle the display of cautionary/courtesy accidentals. Cautionary
accidentals are those not strictly necessary, except in performance
editions where performers are reminded of changes in accidentals
from previous states.

Here's an example of cautionary accidental highlighting after using
the <span class="keypress">alt-shift-x</span> key combination:

{% include image.html
    file="caution-accid.png"
    alt="displaying cautionary accidentals."
    max-width="75%"
    caption="Highlighting cautionary accidentals after pressing alt-shift-x."
%}

Pink accidentals represent cautionary ones. In measures 2 and 3,
accidentals aren't really necessary since the same pitch has already been
altered previously in the measure. However, repeating the accidental
can help prevent performers from playing the note with the wrong
accidental. The E-natural in the sixth measure is typically required
in modern editing standards due to the E-flat in the previous
measures. In modern accidental interpretations, the accidental for
the first note in this measure for the Violin part is automatically
E-natural. However, the previous E-flat may cause the performer to
play an E-natural, or they may wonder if the flat was ommitted accidentally.

This feature is also useful for editing scores to decide if cautionary
accidentals are necessary, and the highlighting allows quick identification
of existing cautionary accidentals to focus on.
