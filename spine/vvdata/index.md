The `**vvdata` data type (exclusive interpretation) is used to display
arbitrary text in music notation as if it were musical lyrics (which
normally uses the `**text` data type.  It is similar to `**vdata`, but
a space within `**vvdata` will cause the following text to be displayed
on the next verse line.  This allows for an arbitrary list stacked text
to be displayed at each position.
