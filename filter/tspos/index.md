The `tspos` filter identifies, labels and analyzes triadic sonorities
(diminished, minor, major, and augmented triads).  The <span
style="color:#DC143C;">root</span> of the triad is colored red, the
<span style="color:#32CD32;">third</span> green, and the <span
style="color:#4169E1;">fifth</span> blue.  This tool is useful to
visualize the triadic degrees used in each voice, as well as
statistics about the inversions these triads.

Here is a basic example:

{% include verovio.html
	source="basic"
	humdrum-min-width="250px"
	humdrum-max-height="250px"
	pageMarginTop="60"
	scale="40"
%}
<script type="application/x-humdrum" id="basic">
